By separating the event form into its own component, you improve the reusability, maintainability, and readability of your code. Here are some advantages of such splits and separations:

1. Reusability: By creating a separate EventForm.vue component, you can reuse it in other parts of your application. For example, you may want to use the same form for editing an existing event. You can easily reuse the EventForm.vue component and pass it the necessary data or props without duplicating code.

2. Maintainability: Separating the form into its own component allows you to focus on the logic and functionality specific to the form. If you need to make changes to the form in the future, you can do so in the EventForm.vue component without affecting other parts of your application. This separation of concerns makes your code more maintainable and easier to debug.

3. Readability: By breaking your code into smaller, more focused components, you make it easier to understand the structure and purpose of each part of your application. This increased readability makes it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to your codebase.

4. To take advantage of this separation, you can:

Pass data from the parent component (CreateEvent.vue) to the child component (EventForm.vue) using props.
Use events to communicate from the child component (EventForm.vue) to the parent component (CreateEvent.vue), e.g., when the form is submitted or any form-related actions are required in the parent component.
