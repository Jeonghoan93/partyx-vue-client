0. PartyX is a platform that connects party hosts with attendees and generates revenue through commissions. To build a backend for this platform using NestJS, you will need to consider the following components:

1. User management: Implement a user authentication and authorization system to handle registration, login, password resets, and role management. You can use Passport.js with NestJS to handle this.

2. Party/event management: Create a system to handle party/event creation, editing, and deletion. This should include features like event details, location, capacity, ticket price, and host information.

3. Booking management: Implement a booking system that allows users to book tickets for events and handles payments. You can use a payment processing service like Stripe for handling transactions.

4. Commission management: Develop a system to calculate and track commissions from each event booking. This should include information about the host's earnings, the platform's commission, and payout processing.

5. Search and filtering: Create a search and filtering system that enables users to find events based on location, date, price, and other criteria.

6. Ratings and reviews: Implement a feature that allows attendees to rate and review events and hosts, which can help future users make informed decisions about attending parties.

7. Notifications and messaging: Implement a messaging system for event updates, booking confirmations, and communication between hosts and attendees. This can be done using email and/or in-app notifications.

8. Analytics and reporting: Develop an analytics system to track important metrics like user registration, event bookings, and revenue generation. This can be used for business analysis and decision-making.

9. API: Design and implement a RESTful API that your frontend can consume to interact with the backend services.

10. Database: Choose a suitable database to store all the data related to users, events, bookings, and other features. Some popular choices are PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

11. Deployment and scaling: Plan for deploying and scaling your backend infrastructure to handle the expected growth in users and events. You can use cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for this.
